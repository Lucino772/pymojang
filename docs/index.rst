PyMojang is a full wrapper of the `Mojang API <https://wiki.vg/Mojang_API>`_ and `Mojang Authentication API <https://wiki.vg/Authentication>`_. It also support the `Microsoft Authentication Scheme <https://wiki.vg/Microsoft_Authentication_Scheme>`_.

You can retrieve basic user information such as their **uuid, skin, cape,...**

Thanks to the **Authentication API**, you can also connect to your account and have access to more data and functionalities like **change your name and your skin**. It also gives you access to a token that can be used when your are making a **launcher**.
